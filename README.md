- **Restaurant Details:** Users can explore individual restaurants and view the list of dishes available in each restaurant.

- **Cart Management:** Users can add items to their cart while browsing restaurants. They can navigate to the cart page to review the summary of their order.

- **Dynamic Location Change:** The app enables users to change their location dynamically using a search API to find restaurants in different areas.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Parcel:** Parcel is used as the bundler, simplifying the setup and build process of the application.
