# Swiggy 2.0 - A Swiggy Clone Web App

Swiggy 2.0 is a personal project that replicates the popular food delivery application Swiggy. This web app is built using React, Parcel as the bundler, Tailwind CSS for styling, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Jest for testing. It incorporates various advanced React concepts and features to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **User Location Detection:** The app utilizes GPS to fetch the user's location and displays nearby restaurants based on their current location.

- **Restaurant Sorting:** Users can sort the displayed restaurants based on delivery time, price (low to high or high to low), ratings, or the default order.

- **Restaurant Details:** Users can explore individual restaurants and view the list of dishes available in each restaurant.

- **Cart Management:** Users can add items to their cart while browsing restaurants. They can navigate to the cart page to review the summary of their order.

- **Dynamic Location Change:** The app enables users to change their location dynamically using a search API to find restaurants in different areas.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **Parcel:** Parcel is used as the bundler, simplifying the setup and build process of the application.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the app, allowing for efficient and customizable styling using utility classes.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is used for state management, providing a standardized way to manage and update the application's state.

- **Jest:** Jest is the chosen testing library for unit testing components and ensuring their functionality.

## Advanced React Concepts

- **Custom Hooks:** The app utilizes custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic, improving code organization and reusability.

- **Context API:** The Context API is employed to manage and share state across components without excessive prop drilling.

- **React Portals:** React portals are used to render modals and overlays, providing a better user experience for certain interactions.
